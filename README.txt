Conway's Game of Tron is a game designed to combine the mechanics of the
famous Tron and Conway's Game of Life.

HOW TO RUN:
If you're on Linux, run main.
If you're on Windows, run main.exe.

MENUS:
    Arrow keys - navigate
    Enter - select

HOW TO PLAY:
Movement is done with the keys displayed in the menu.
(e.g. for Player 1, the WASD keys are used
  W
  |
A- -D
  |
  S
These keys are used to move your moving 'trail' around.

The goal of the game is to avoid running into any 'live' cell and outlive your
opponents. I tried to make most things configurable via the menu. Increasing
the FPS can make the game much more hectic, especially with four players.

Lower FPS and a smaller map size can help reduce stuttering or lag for those
with not-so-powerful computers (like me).

Have fun!
